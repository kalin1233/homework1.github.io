    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Hello, My name is Kalin Toussaint. I am a senior at Boston University studying Computer Science. I am taking this course at UMass Lowell because BU has unrealistic prices for a summer course.</p>

            <p>I love playing sports as shown below. I also love watching anime and learning new programming skills as shown in my GitHub below too.
                I hope to improve my programming skills while taking this course as I have a lot of ideas and websites to create for myself and my friends. Let's have fun!! :)</p>

            <p>Welcome to my personal page! Here you can learn about my interests, hobbies, and some of the projects I've worked on during my time studying Computer Science at Boston University.
                I am passionate about web development and always eager to learn new technologies. Below, you will find links to some interesting websites and my GitHub profile where I showcase my projects.</p>
